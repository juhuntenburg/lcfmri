          Inpainting, and Segmentation

       Pascal Getreuer, December 2010


The tvreg package applies total variation (TV) regularization to
perform image denoising, deconvolution, and inpainting. Three different
noise models are supported: Gaussian (L2), Laplace (L1), and Poisson.
The implementation solves the general TV restoration problem

                  /
   Min  TV(u)  +  | lambda F(K*u,f) dx,
    u             /

to perform denoising, deconvolution, and inpainting as special cases.
It is efficiently solved using the recent split Bregman method.  Also
included is an efficient implementation of Chan-Vese two-phase 
segmentation.  All functions support grayscale, color, and arbitrary
multichannel images.

Please see the included documentation file tvreg.pdf for details.


   ---------------------
    Get Started Quickly
   ---------------------

1. Install the FFTW library (http://www.fftw.org).  Windows users can
   download precompiled .dll files from 
       http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html.

2. Compile the programs with GCC using "make -f makefile.gcc" or
   Microsoft Visual C++ using "nmake -f makefile.vc".  See section 7 of
   the documentation for help.

3. Try the demos

   tvdenoise_demo     Total variation denoising demo
   tvdeconv_demo      Total variation deconvolution demo
   tvinpaint_demo     Total variation inpainting demo
   chanvese_demo      Chan-Vese segmentation demo

    Get Started Quickly in MATLAB
   -------------------------------

Compiling is not required to use tvreg in MATLAB.  Try the demos

   tvdenoise_demo     Total variation denoising demo
   tvdeconv_demo      Total variation deconvolution demo
   tvinpaint_demo     Total variation inpainting demo
   chanvese_demo      Chan-Vese segmentation demo

For improved performance, run the included script "complex_mex.m" to
compile the main computation routines as MEX functions.  This requires
that FFTW is installed, please see section 7.3 of the documentation.
